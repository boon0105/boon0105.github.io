        <p class="blog-size size"> First, you had to apply to two companies that you would like to know more information
          about. The first period was easy for me, Damen is a company which I already knew but didn't know alot about.
          The second period I visited veracode, this was way to complicated for me and also not that interesting.</p>
        <p class="blog-size size"> In the afternoon we had to make a pster for a company, this company was given to us. At
          first I wasn't that interested in the company Atos. But when looking up more information about it I started to
          enjoy it.</p>

          <h4>Why would I like to work here?</h4>
          <section>
            <p class="size">The size of the company is very impressive and because the company is home in so many
              branches you can basically work in wathever situation you want to. </p>
            <p class="size">The company also gives alot of oppotunities to grow and become a better version of yourself,
              this is very interesting to me.</p>
            <p class="size">The only downside that I could think of is that because of the size of the company there
              might not be alot of personal attention for if you (for exemple) have questinos.</p>

          <h4>Why would I like to work here?</h4>
          <section>
            <p class="size">I've always liked going to the Damen shipyard in Vlissingen when I was younger. But I
              thought that there wouldn't be a job for me there now that I'm doing the ICT study, so naturally when I
              heard that there were alot of jobs for us at Damen I was very happy.</p>
            <p class="size">I would like to work at Damen because of the size. All the boats they built are different so
              it's always an adventure what's going to happen.</p>
            <p class="size">The only downside that I can think of is that there are alot of secrets that come with the
              job, and it's difficault for me to keep those to my grandpa.</p>
